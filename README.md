# Hoppy : a C++ game engine written by Epitech students

Hoppy is a WIP game engine written by Epitech students.\
It is written in C++ in an imperative/procedural style.
The goal is to write a powerful engine that anyone can use to make games, with the objective of being the fastest and lightest game engine we could ever write.

## The team

- Damian Gil (Project Manager)
- Milo Heinrich (Lead Programmer and Designer)

## The plan

The plan is to create a fully functional cross-platform game engine, that can run as fast as possible on any machine.\
Some of the features that we want to add include:
- An audio system supporting 3D spatialized audio and audio effects
- A job system capable of queuing tasks intelligently and parallelizing jobs
- An extended input system supporting all kind of input devices (gamepads, keyboards, mice, touch screens...)
- A powerful networking system that supports TCP, UDP and HTTP networking
- A physics system capable of simulating real time simulations of objects
- A fully customisable renderer
- User capability to write custom shaders for the renderer
- User capability to write compute shaders and interact with the GPU easily
- A cross platform RHI supporting many APIs
- A scripting module powered by AngelScript
- A simple yet powerful world management with an ECS
